# The DMV

## Project Overview

As you know, this project was abandoned recently by the last developer hired by the DMV. Here’s where you come in. Take some time to explore this code base. You’ll probably find some bugs that need to be fixed, and then you’ll get to add in the remaining functionality that was never built.

The specifications give you some classes to help you start breaking this problem down, but you will also have to create some additional classes and methods to build an Object Oriented solution to this problem.

## Tools Used

- TDD


## Programming Paradigms

- Ext. Data
- Existing Codebase
